  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>I am currently a fourth semester student of Systems Engineering at the Escuela Polit√©cnica Nacional. My areas of interest include software development, Java application development, database management, and DevOps.</p>

  <p>I am learning Python and I have some certifications in the area of computer science. I also have experience with Emacs, Jupyter Notebooks, advanced Java, and APIs. Additionally, I have a certification in hardware and customer service, and I am learning a bit of French.</p>

  <p>Outside of IT, I am interested in fitness, building an aesthetic body, and general health. I also enjoy reading books on personal development.</p>
