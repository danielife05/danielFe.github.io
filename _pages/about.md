## About Me

I am currently a fourth semester student of Systems Engineering at the Escuela Politécnica Nacional. My areas of interest include software development, Java application development, database management and DevOps.

I am learning Python and I have some certifications in the area of computer science.

Outside of IT, I am interested in fitness, building an aesthetic body and general health.
