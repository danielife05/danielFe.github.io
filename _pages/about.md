Currently, I am a fourth-semester student in the Computer Science Engineering program at Escuela Politécnica Nacional. My areas of interest include software development, creating applications in Java, database management, and DevOps.

I am currently learning Python, I have some certifications in the computer science area

Outside of computer science, I like fitness, building an aesthetic body and health in general.
